# maze-solving-bot-using-dfs
We have created a general algorithm to solve a maze, irrespective of the complexity. 
# Notes
motors are connected as follows:
forward [7, 11]\
backward [8, 12]\
enable [9, 10]\
__
Encoders: [3, 2]\
\
Sensors:\
\
[left, left-front, right-front, right]\
[4   ,          5,           6,    13]
