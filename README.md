# maze-solving-bot-using-dfs
We have created a general algorithm to solve a maze, irrespective of the complexity. 
# Notes
motors are connected as follows:
forward [7, 11]__
backward [8, 12]__
enable [9, 10]__
__
Encoders: [3, 2]__
__
Sensors:__
[left, left-front, right-front, right]__
[4   ,          5,           6,    13]__
