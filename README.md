# maze-solving-bot-using-dfs
We have created a general algorithm to solve a maze, irrespective of the complexity. 
# Notes
motors are connected as follows:\
forward  [18, 19]\
backward [20, 21]\
enable   [16, 17]\
Encoders [14, 15]\
\
Sensors:\
\
[left, left-front, right-front, right]\
[   2,          3,           4,    5]\
SCL : 9\
SDA : 8\
\
Buzzer : 13\
switch : 12\
